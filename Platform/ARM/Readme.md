# Introduction

These instructions explain how to get an edk2/edk2-platforms build running
on the Arm Base FVP and a Juno. The Arm Base FVP is a software model provided by ARM (for free)
, which models a Cortex A core with various peripherals. More information
can be found [here](https://developer.arm.com/products/system-design/fixed-virtual-platforms).

## Build environment setup on Linux or Windows

### Initial steps

The first step towards building an EDKII firmware image is to create a working directory.

1. Launch a terminal window.
2. Create a directory on your development machine (we willl name it 'source' in this example).
3. Set the WORKSPACE environment variable to point to this directory.

#### Example:
In a Linux bash shell:
```
cd <Directory where you want to work>
mkdir source
cd source
export WORKSPACE=$PWD
```

OR

In a Windows command prompt:

```
cd <Directory where you want to work>
mkdir source
cd source
set WORKSPACE=%CD%
```

### Cloning the source code repositories

Note: To clone the repositories you need 'git' to be installed on your development PC (see Development Tools).

In the terminal window, change directory to your workspace ('source') folder and run the following commands. Install Git if necessary.

```
git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git
git clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-platforms.git
git clone https://github.com/acpica/acpica.git
```

Then go to the edk2 folder and update the submodules.

```
cd edk2
git submodule update --init
cd ..
```

### Arm cross compiler toolchain

The Arm toolchain to cross compile from x86_64-linux to aarch64-elf is available [here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).

Select the latest toolchain to match the development PC architecture. Select the little-endian 'AArch64 ELF bare-metal target (aarch64-elf)' GCC cross compiler.

Example: For a x86_64 development PC, download arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz

Create a directory called 'toolchain' under the workspace folder. For example source\toolchain and extract the toolchain to this directory.

```
$ mkdir $WORKSPACE/toolchain
$ cd $WORKSPACE/toolchain
$ wget https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/downloads/gnu/12.2.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz

## Setting up the development tools

Install the required development tools listed above by running the appropriate installer applications.

### Arm cross compiler toolchain
The Arm toolchain Windows (i686-mingw32) hosted cross compilers are available [here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).

Select the latest toolchain for 'AArch64 bare-metal target (aarch64-none-elf)' GCC cross compiler.

Example: Download arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-mingw-w64-i686-aarch64-none-elf

Create a directory called 'toolchain' under the workspace directory and extract the toolchain to this directory using the downloaded installer.

The toolchain folder tree should look as below:

```
toolchain
+---arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-mingw-w64-i686-aarch64-none-elf
|   +---aarch64-none-elf
|   +---bin
|   +---include
|   +---lib
|   +---libexec
|   +---share
```

### Workaround for the echo command

EDKII needs a workaround related to the echo command. A script replacing the Windows echo executable must be created, with the name "echo.BAT?:

- Create a file named "echo.BAT" in the folder of your choice.
- Paste the following lines inside the file:

```
rem %~f0  echo.BAT  %*
rem This file exists to overcome a problem in the EDKII build where
rem build_rule.template invokes a command as:
rem     "$(OBJCOPY)" $(OBJCOPY_FLAGS) ${dst}
rem When OBJCOPY is set to echo, this results in the following error:
rem     "echo" objcopy not needed for m:\...\PCD\Dxe\Pcd\DEBUG\PcdDxe.dll
rem And CMD.EXE fails to find the DOS echo command because of the quotes
@echo %*
@goto :EOF
```

- Add the file to your PATH by executing:
```
> set PATH=<Path_to_the_echo_file>;%PATH%
```

## Building EDKII firmware

1. To build the firmware image, follow the steps below and run the commands in the terminal window.
2. Set up the environment variables.

```
 set GCC5_AARCH64_PREFIX=%WORKSPACE%\toolchain\arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-mingw-w64-i686-aarch64-none-elf\bin\aarch64-none-elf-
 set PACKAGES_PATH=%WORKSPACE%\edk2;%WORKSPACE%\edk2-platforms
 set EDK_TOOLS_PATH=%WORKSPACE%\edk2\BaseTools
 set GCC_HOST_BIN=n
```

Select the python version you wish to use and set the PYTHON_COMMAND environment variable to your Python executable.

Set the PYTHON_COMMAND to point to the Python3 executable.

Check that your path is set up as it is stated in the development tools table above. It should give access to:

- The make executable
- The echo.BAT script

3. Configure the EDKII development environment by running the edksetup.bat script.
The Rebuild option can be skipped if the BaseTools have already been built.

The ForceRebuild option can be used to do a clean build of the Base tools.
```
> call %WORKSPACE%\edk2\edksetup.bat [Rebuild | ForceRebuild]
```
